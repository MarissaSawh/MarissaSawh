### Overview

Kate Holterhoff’s Visual Haggard is a digital humanities project created in 2015. It provides online access to illustrations in H. Rider Haggard’s nineteenth-century novels. Along with 2,173 pictures, there is information about the novels and illustrators. It has links that connect readers to the novels in an online format. By making the artwork and novels accessible online, the project allows for any individual to expand upon their interest in learning about Haggard’s work.

### About _Visual Haggard_

Before looking through the artwork in Visual Haggard, the site directs the user to the “homepage,” which is split into two parts. On the left side of the “homepage”, the purpose of the project is under the heading “The Illustration Archive.” On the right side, the heading “How to Get Started” provides a tutorial on how to use the site. On the left side of the header has written “VisualHaggard.org” that brings the user back to the “homepage.” However, it is unclear that “VisualHaggard.org” is even clickable. An easier way to show that this link brings the user to the “home screen” would be to create a tab with a label such as “home page”.

On the right side of the header is a search engine bar that allows users to explore the site. In addition, there are tabs labeled as “Novels,” “Illustrators,” “Biography,” and “Editor’s Statement.” However, the tabs do not appear when the window of the page is not on full-screen view. This makes it difficult for users that want to work with a split-screen set-up. On the other hand, the tabs organize the site making it fast and easy to use.

The “Novels” tab brings the user to the first page of six, which has illustrations from particular novels. The page has three rows each with four illustrations. While using the site, the pictures seemed to lag when going from one page to another. When the user clicks on an illustration, it takes them to a page with information about the novel. It contains a description of the novel and other editions the illustration/ novel relates to. At the bottom of each page is a comment section that allows individuals to interact and discuss the novel.

For the “Illustrators” tab, it brings the user to a page that lists all the illustrators in paragraph form that is separated by a vertical line. Thus, the page looks overwhelming and it is hard to read. When scrolling over a name, the name goes from grey to black, however, it is hard to see the difference in color. Instead, it could be helpful if the name was also underlined or bolded. By clicking either a name listed at the top of the page or the illustration at the bottom half of the page, it brings the user to a page that has information about the illustrator, pictures, and novels.

The site is interactive because users can click on different images. By doing so information is "unlocked," then users can explore information about a novel or illustrator. Holterhoff takes pictures that are difficult to find in hard-copy novels. Then, she puts them in an online format to “fill a scholarly void” because access to the illustrations is hard to find. Holterhoff uses the software GIMP to “restore the illustration’s appearance.” That way, users can see the image clearly while also riding the image of any changes that may have occurred over time. Another interactive feature is being able to access the books through links, such as Google Books or Internet Archive.

### _Visual Haggard_ on Mobile Devices

Visual Haggard on mobile devices offers the same setup. Similar to the problem of trying to view the site on a small viewing window, such as a phone, the tabs do not appear on the top of the page. Additionally, the titles and pictures on the “Novels” page do not line up, making the page look unorganized. After clicking on a picture, the information presented goes down the right side of the screen. This results in excessive scrolling since the information is against one side. However, this version still offers plenty of scholarly content on mobile devices.

### Overall

Visual Haggard gives individuals access to illustrations used in Haggard’s novels. Users can read information about different novels and illustrators based on the pictures they choose to explore.
