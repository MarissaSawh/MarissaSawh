### Overview

“Beijing of Dreams” is a project of The History of Chinese Society and Culture Foundation. It was created in 2011 by Professor Robert Temple and designed by Jonathan Greet. This digital humanities project is a collection of pictures from Old Beijing China. The purpose of this project is to keep the beauty of old Beijing alive and make sure it is not forgotten. Looking into the past illustrates how the city has changed over time.

### About the Project

One’s journey through old Beijing begins on the home page of “Beijing of Dreams.” It gives a description of the project as well as its purpose. The bottom of this section also gives information about who worked on the project and the sources of the pictures. The site is like an old photograph because of the white and black color scheme; there are headings in red along the top of the page. 

From left to right on the page the headings read “Home,”  “Interactive Map,” “Gates,” “Walls & Corners,” “Miscellaneous,” “All Images,” and “Old Map.” The headings at the top of the page indicate what pictures can be found in that section. While using the interactive map, the "Home" tab option does not work; instead, a user must go to a different section. Then, the "home" option will work.

The heading “Interactive Map” brings the user to a map of old Beijing, China. While there are no instructions on the interactive map, it is easy to figure out after playing around with it a little. The map has the same color scheme as the rest of the site. The area of Old Beijing is in dark grey, while the white color outlines areas inside the city walls like structures, streets, and more. These features on the map are also labeled in white, which seems "blurry" because the color is used a lot. It would be helpful if there were other colors used, like one color to outline streets and another color for Temples, and so forth. It would also be helpful if there was a legend that indicated what the symbols in red represented.

While the map is very detailed and informative about the city, there is no way to zoom out of the map to see it as a whole. The only way to see the map as a whole is to change the entire view of the page. Despite not being able to zoom out to see the whole map, the user can zoom in and interact with the map. A feature that allows users to see the differences between the maps on the site would also be useful.
