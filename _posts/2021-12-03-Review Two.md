### Overview

“Beijing of Dreams” is a project of The History of Chinese Society and Culture Foundation. It was created in 2011 by Professor Robert Temple and designed by Jonathan Greet. This digital humanities project is a collection of pictures from Old Beijing China. The purpose of this project is to keep the beauty of old Beijing alive and make sure it is not forgotten. Looking into the past illustrates how the city has changed over time.

### About the Project

One’s journey through old Beijing begins on the home page of “Beijing of Dreams.” It gives a description of the project as well as its purpose. The bottom of this section also gives information about who worked on the project and the sources of the pictures. The site is like an old photograph because of the white and black color scheme; there are headings in red along the top of the page. 

From left to right on the page the headings read “Home,”  “Interactive Map,” “Gates,” “Walls & Corners,” “Miscellaneous,” “All Images,” and “Old Map.” The headings at the top of the page indicate what pictures can be found in that section. While using the interactive map, the "Home" tab option does not work; instead, a user must go to a different section. Then, the "home" option will work.

The heading “Interactive Map” brings the user to a map of old Beijing, China. While there are no instructions on the interactive map, it is easy to figure out after playing around with it a little. The map has the same color scheme as the rest of the site. The area of Old Beijing is in dark grey, while the white color outlines areas inside the city walls like structures, streets, and more. These features on the map are also labeled in white, which seems "blurry" because the color is used a lot. It would be helpful if there were other colors used, like one color to outline streets and another color for Temples, and so forth. It would also be helpful if there was a legend that indicated what the symbols in red represented.

While the map is very detailed and informative about the city, there is no way to zoom out of the map to see it as a whole. The only way to see the map as a whole is to change the entire view of the page. Despite not being able to zoom out to see the whole map, the user can zoom in and interact with the map. A feature that allows users to see the differences between the maps on the site would also be useful.

The red symbols on the map represent the gates, walls, and corners; these correspond with the headings at the top of the page. By clicking on a red symbol, it takes the user to the section of the site that coincides with those sets of pictures. For instance, clicking on a gate symbol will bring the user to the section "Gates" that has all the gate pictures. This is also the same process for the wall or corner symbols on the map. One thing to note is that clicking on the symbol does not take you directly to a specific picture or subsection, but just to the different tabs themselves.
 
The symbols linked with other sections of the page keep the site organized because it’s easy to find where the pictures are. However, it would be helpful if there was a search bar, especially for the “Miscellaneous” and “All Images” sections to make finding pictures faster. This would pose difficulties for some users because some of the names for pictures, especially in the gate section, are in Chinese.

While the site does provide pictures that show the beauty of Beijing in the past, there is no information to accompany the pictures. It would be beneficial to users if there was some history about the city provided, either with each picture or in its own section on the site.

Robert Temple provided sources from his personal collection to provide pictures for the project. Sources included Osvald Siren's book "The Walls and Gates of Peking" and Heinz von Perckhammer's book "Peking." Some photos were also enhanced by Michael Lee.

In addition, I  explored the site for roughly an hour and a half until the site “could no longer be reached.” The longer I used the site, the slower the site became, and eventually it shut down. However, this only occurred once out of the many times I used the site.
 
### Notable Features

The premise of the project does a great job including the digital humanities value of diversity. While the feature for the site to be in Chinese is not yet available, it will allow users who speak Chinese to be more submerged in the culture. The project also works very fast and easily on mobile devices.

### Conclusion

“Beijing of Dreams” allows users to journey through the city of Old Beijing through maps and pictures. Thus, the site works to keep the history and beauty of the city alive today.
