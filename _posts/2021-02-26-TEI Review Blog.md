# Review of TEI
By Marissa Sawh

### Overview
For the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) assignment, I coded pages 43-46 in the short story “The Yellow Wall-paper” by Charlotte Perkins Stetson (Gilman). Before using TEI, I went through the text on a Google document and marked parts of the story that I would have to code later on. After this simplified version of coding, I then put the text into the program Oxygen that uses TEI to actually code the text.  This process broke down the assignment step-by-step and made coding effortless.

### The Project
When I first was presented with the task to code a portion of “The Yellow Wall-paper,” the only thought I had in my head was “oh no here we go again...coding.” In my freshman year of college, I took the computer science course, Introduction to Computing, where I had an assignment to create and code my own website. Although I was satisfied with my website in the end, I was genuinely lost for the duration of the project.  However, after this digital humanities project, I have a whole new perspective on coding.
	
Before using the software Oxygen, I marked up the text on a more familiar software, Google Docs. I highlighted parts of the text to indicate what needed to be tagged. Then, I would attach a comment to the highlighted text that stated what tag to use later on in Oxygen. This made it easy to code because I was able to break down the work into smaller and more simplified steps; then progressing to the harder part of the assignment, coding.

After I practiced the simplified version of coding on the google document, I copied and pasted the text into Oxygen. A program that uses TEI,  a set of standard eXtensible Markup Language, also known as XML. As soon as I opened up a new file and chose the “manuscript description” template, I was immediately intimidated and overwhelmed by the number of tags on the screen.

So I reformatted my laptop screen; one side with Oxygen and the other with the tutorial created by my digital humanities professor. The tutorial walked me through how to use the program and the assignment transformed from daunting to enjoyable. At this point, I was just copying and pasting the text from my google document into Oxygen. Then, I put in the tags that I had already indicated in the google document as well. 

Tags that I marked included page beginning, paragraphs, weird spaces, underlined words, em-dashes, wrong spelling, and crossed-out text. From this point on in the project, I had the mentality of “sure that looks like a code...why not…?” and was just kind of going for it. 

I struggled most with the paragraph tags. Since throughout my education, it was ingrained into my brain that paragraphs should range from 5-7 sentences, but I was using the tag “paragraph” for just single sentences. So it felt like I was using the code wrong. 

Another code that was difficult was the code to correct spelling because it was so long and I just wanted to give up. However, after looking at the code again I realized how easy and simple it was since it states where to put the original spelling and the corrected version. Even though I struggled initially with some codes it was actually very straightforward; it just takes practice. I was able to fix my work through trial and error by using the green valid code box and the “author view” mode; these features made me more confident in my work.

### Conclusion

Through this project, I now understand the importance of TEI to store data and maintain documentation of a text. Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed this project and am no longer intimidated by coding.
