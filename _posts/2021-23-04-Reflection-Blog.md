## Grant Process Reflection

### “A Walk Through the Neighborhood”

My project is “A Walk Through the Neighborhood.” It is a series of archival images that will allow site users to explore neighborhoods affected by redlining. It uses many features such as maps, charts, compare/contrasting, and a timeline to show the differences over the years and how redlining affected the development of communities as well as it’s residents. The reason I chose this project is because my current goal after pursuing my masters is to go into community development. This is because communities are often a determiner in what opportunities are given to individuals. However, less developed communities are often the ones that were redlined in the past. Thus, I used the project to further explore this topic and how I could use digital humanities in my field of study.  My project has not had any major changes since I wrote my first abstract. The only significant change was shifting the location of the research from Hampton, Virginia to Richmond Virginia.

### Similarities and Differences
 
I ended-up switching the area because the project “Living Together/ Living Apart” created by individuals at Christopher Newport University was already centered around the Newport News area and was also about redlining. So, my digital humanities professor recommended that I change the location to help my project stand-out more. In addition, the project “Mapping Inequality: Redlining in New Deal America” by American Panorama is similar to both mine and “Living Together/ Living Apart.” 

The biggest difference between my project and the others is that I am incorporating both qualitative and quantitative information in my project. While my project will include similar features to the other projects such as maps, demographics, and housing information, it will also include features that show the differences in neighborhoods through timelines, graphs, compare/contrast options, and most importantly archival images. 

These features will allow people of all educational levels to understand the significance of redlining because the information is presented in many different visual formats to show the effects of redlining. In addition, the photographs will display the data, such as with information on housing prices and living conditions, to depict the environments individuals were forced to live in. Thus, it creates the effect of walking through different neighborhoods during the time that racial segregation was being aided by governmental programs.

### Just Keep Walking…

I think over the course of writing the grant I got more confused. This was because I was trying to describe a concept I could only see in my head. I am more of a visualizer than a writer, so taking an image that was not fully formed and trying to create a whole project from it, along with researching similar projects and budgeting was difficult. It became harder as I got further into the grant writing process because my project had to be more narrow and specific. 

At times, I wanted to scrap the entire proposal because I thought it was too similar to other projects and the way I was imagining it in my head was not different enough. The only reason why I did not delete all the work was because I was too far into it and was proud of the work I had already put in. I learned to turn my attention to what made the project different instead of focusing on the similarities. It made me want to pursue my project more because I came up with the concept of “walking through Google Maps through the years;” it would show how places changed and help with understanding the history behind each place. 

This helped me to understand my project had to offer. It made me realize that my project was not just about demographics, housing projects, or showing how this perpetuated the wealth gap that exists today. It adds information about how many Americans are still affected today by the history of redlining and provides a solution to one contributor to inequality, which is the root of the problem.

## Reflection on the Class

“What does digital humanities mean to you?” Well, to be completely honest, I am still not completely sure. Everytime I try to think about defining digital humanities, it feels like I am living in Jason Heppler’s “What is Digital Humanities” webpage and someone is attacking the “refresh the page” button, to find the “right” and all encompassing definition. That said, I understand it based on my professor’s slide show image from the first day of class:

I understand it is a mix of humanities practice and technology. I understand it is an educational and research-based project that allows users to interact with the presentation of the information. However, I do not think I could teach someone what digital humanities is. My understanding of the field is primarily based on the digital humanities projects we looked at in class and for homework as well as by writing reviews of projects. However, one singular definition? That I don’t know.

### Class Reading Material

The readings did add to my understanding of course content. It provided a baseline understanding that helped me through class powerpoints. This is primarily because I was able to concentrate more in class because I was not getting lost through material. Even if I did not fully understand a reading, there was always a quote or an example that would help me grasp onto what I was supposed to gain from readings. The most helpful reading was “Why Academics Have a Hard Time Writing Good Grant Proposals” by Robert Porter because it helped me understand the difference between a grant proposal and academic writing. The most difficult reading was “DSC #5: The DCS and the Impossible TEI Quandaries” by Elisa Bonder, et al. primarily because it was long and found it hard to understand. The least helpful, but also one of my favorites, was Anne Lamott’s piece because it was short and the piece was summarized by its title.

### Course Work

For the most part I enjoyed every project...except maybe the grant project. The research blog posts were my favorite. I found it really fun to do because the style of writing is very different from my other courses. I was writing “papers” but not writing “papers.” It was less about stressing the facts and more about analysis, persuasiveness, creativity, and performance. All of my other courses this year were like 10-15 page research papers and it took away the joy of communicating through writing. This course reminded me how writing can be enjoyable and fun. 

By looking at other projects, it helped me to see what digital humanities is all about. It showed me what digital humanists do as well as how they can change and add to every field of study. However, the grant project was my least favorite solely because my project was so similar to other projects that already existed. While that is not bad, it did create this overarching sense of anxiety of wondering if it is “good enough.”

### Growth as a Student

From this course, I have grown as a digital humanist, reader, and writer. Firstly, I learned what a digital humanist is, what they do and how I could be one for my field of study. However, there is definitely some more growth needed. As a reader, I have also learned how to analyze and critique projects that made its way to critiquing readings in general. The area I grew the most in, however, is as a writer.

The ways I have grown as a writer is not how I imagined it to be. I expected to go into this writing intensive course hating it. Expecting huge overwhelming papers that I would dread to complete and the expected takeaway: learning to do big stressful writing assignments. Instead, it was the complete opposite. I learned to “let go” as a writer. I learned that it is okay to have a “crappy first draft” in words similar to Anne Lamott. I learned that I can be personable and professional. I learned how to enjoy writing again, which was stripped away by years of school work.
